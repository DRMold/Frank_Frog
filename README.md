This is the implementation of our software project for CSC 4330:

FRANKIE THE FROG

The goal of this game is to design a fun educational game for the K-12 grades as
a study aide for learning the Life Cycle of a Frog.

Our project is laid out as follows:

All items in our Assets folder are the resources that we made for our project.
The Scripts folder contains our source code.

Unity 5 generates a lot of meta files and binaries. Please consult the .gitignore to see which files this may include.
